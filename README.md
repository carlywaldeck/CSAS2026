## Submission Contents

### 1. Final Report
**`FINAL_REPORT_CSAS2026.md`**  
The complete strategic analysis report answering Coach Phil Lazar's question about early Power Play deployment. This report includes:
- Executive Summary: The Lazar Paradox
- Section 1: The Conservation Deadlock (scarcity finding)
- Section 2: Aggression vs. Insurance framework
- Section 3: Traffic metric and Traffic Tax discovery
- Section 4: Execution Floor analysis
- Section 5: Pairing Variance (human element)
- Strategic Recommendations & Conclusion

### 2. Analysis Code
**`challenge_analysis.py`**  
Python script that performs all calculations referenced in the report:
- Traffic calculation (stones in house within 600 units of button)
- Power Play deployment distribution analysis
- Expected value comparison by end
- Traffic Tax calculation (efficiency drop in high congestion)
- Execution score analysis (Draws vs. Wicks)
- Visualization generation

**Dependencies:**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 challenge_analysis.py
```

This script will output all statistics referenced in the report, including:
- Traffic statistics by end
- Power Play efficiency by Traffic level
- Execution score comparisons
- Deployment distribution tables

### 3. Visualization
**`power_play_by_end.png`**  
Bar chart showing Power Play effectiveness by end number (generated by challenge_analysis.py).

## Key Findings

1. **Conservation Deadlock:** Only 1 End 1-2 Power Play out of 5,274 ends analyzed
2. **Traffic Tax:** High Traffic (5+ stones) reduces Power Play efficiency by 12.3%
3. **Execution Floor:** Draws (3.13/4.0) outperform Wicks (2.75/4.0) by 13.6%
4. **Closer's Dividend:** End 8 Power Play averages 2.51 points (highest efficiency)
5. **Pairing Variance:** Strategy should vary by pair profile (Power Hitter vs. Contact Hitter)

## Methodology

All calculations use the exact coordinate specifications from the challenge:
- Button position: $(x=750, y=800)$
- House radius: 600 units
- Center corridor: $|x - 750| < 200$
- Sentinel values: $(x=4095, y=4095)$ for removed stones

The Traffic metric counts stones within 600 units of the button, excluding sentinel values and unthrown stones.

## Data Source

Analysis based on data from Curlit:
- Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games
- World Mixed Doubles Curling Championships 2023-2025

**Note:** CSV data files are not included in this submission as per challenge requirements. The analysis script expects CSV files in the same directory when executed.

---

## Reproducibility

To reproduce all results:
1. Place CSV files (Stones.csv, Ends.csv, etc.) in the same directory
2. Run `python3 challenge_analysis.py`
3. All statistics referenced in the report will be printed to console
4. Visualization will be saved as `power_play_by_end.png`
