# CSAS 2026 Submission: The "First Strike" Analytical Framework

This repository contains the complete analytical framework for optimizing the Mixed Doubles Power Play, developed by a group of three researchers with backgrounds in the baseball industry.

## **Core Submission Documents**
1.  **[Submission_Dissertation.md](Submission_Dissertation.md)**: The definitive 2000-word research paper detailing the "Fireman and the Closer" philosophy, XGBoost modeling, and strategic validation.
2.  **[Report.md](Report.md)**: The **12-Section Elite Bench Manual** for real-time coaching decision support.
3.  **[Executive_Summary.md](Executive_Summary.md)**: A high-level overview of our 6 core innovations for the competition jury.

## **Visual Assets**
- **[Shot_3_EV_Map.png](Shot_3_EV_Map.png)**: Spatial mapping of Expected Value (EV) by ice state.
- **[Defensive_Positioning.png](Defensive_Positioning.png)**: Target zones for neutralizing opponent Power Plays.

## **Analytical Engine (Scripts)**
- **compute_competition_metrics.py**: The primary processing engine for EV calcs and the Chaos State Index (CSI).
- **final_data_audit.py**: Statistical verification and performance decomposition.
- **analyze_pp_timing.py**: Research foundation for the "First Strike" strategy.
- **analyze_usa.py**: Identification of the "Chaos Agent" tactical identity.
- **analyze_bimodal_utility.py**: Validation of scoring vs. stability modes.
- **analyze_opening_scripts.py**: Mapping of the first three stones to end outcomes.
- **analyze_side_bias.py**: Quantifying the "Hot Turn" handle bias.
- **analyze_benchmarking.py**: International performance and execution benchmarks.

## **Data Basis**
The framework is anchored in the provided **Stones.csv** (~26k throws) and **Ends.csv** (~5.2k ends) datasets.
