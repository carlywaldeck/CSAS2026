# Mixed Doubles Curling: The Power Play Strategy Report
**Analysis of Great Britain's "Silent Assassin" Approach**

## 1. Strategic Timing: When is the optimal time to deploy?

**The "Clutch" Window: Ends 5-7 while Trailing**
Data analysis of Great Britain's matches reveals a distinct pattern. Unlike teams that "panic" early or "waste" the Power Play when comfortably ahead, GBR deploys it almost exclusively in the **Second Half (Ends 5-7)** and predominantly when **trailing by 1-3 points**.

*   **Observed Usage:**
    *   **Ends used:** 5, 6, and 7 (Zero usage in first half).
    *   **Score State:** 70% of usage occurred when trailing (Score Diff -1 to -3).
    *   **Sweet Spot:** The most frequent usage is Ends 6/7 when down by 1 point. This sets up a "tying or leading" scenario going into the final end.

**Recommendation:** Hold the Power Play for the "Championship Rounds" (Ends 6-8). Using it early wastes a critical comeback mechanic. Using it when ahead is often overkill. The optimal time is when you need to manufacture a "guaranteed" 2-point swing to regain control.

## 2. Shot Selection: The "No-Fly Zone" Protocol

**The First Shot Paradox**
Conventional wisdom suggests placing a Guard to protect the Power Play zone. However, our data proves this is a **strategic error**.

*   **The "Guard" Trap:** Across the entire field, teams that opened with a **Guard** on their first shot scored an average of only **1.18 points**—the worst return of any common shot. It invites the opponent to simply draw around or tick it.
*   **The GBR Solution:** Great Britain chose a **Guard 0% of the time**. Instead, they opted for an active **Draw (70%)** or **Raise (20%)**.
    *   **Draw Expectancy:** 1.67 Points
    *   **Raise Expectancy:** 1.85 Points

**Conclusion:** The most effective opening sequence is **offensive**. Ignore the instinct to hide. Place a stone in the scoring area immediately. This forces the opponent to deal with *two* point-scoring threats rather than one stationary guard.

## 3. Comparative Analysis: Why GBR Wins on Power Plays

**Consistency over Explosion**
Great Britain isn't trying to score 4 points; they are ensuring they don't score 0.
*   **Conversion Rate (Scoring 2+):** GBR converts **50%** of Power Plays into multi-point ends (Field: 46%).
*   **Big End Rate (Scoring 3+):** GBR only scores big **10%** of the time (Field: 21%).

**The Secret Sauce:** By rejecting high-variance shots (like the Corner Guard setup that hopes for a 3), GBR eliminates the "Steal" risk. They play a "boring" game that mathematically guarantees a moderate advantage, grinding opponents down with reliability rather than flashiness.

## 4. Defensive Considerations: How to Defend Against It

**The "Active Disruption" Defense**
When facing a Power Play, passivity is death. Our analysis of Shot 1 effectiveness (the defensive opener) shows clear winners and losers:
*   **Worst Defense:** **Front** (Op. PP Score: 1.84) or **Draw** (1.80). Passive placement allows the PP team to dictate terms.
*   **Best Defense:** **Raise** (1.36) or **Wick** (1.47).

**Guidance:** Do not simply draw into the house. Use a **Raise** or **Wick** to disturb the pre-placed stones immediately. Chaos favors the defender in a Power Play scenario. If you can move their pre-placed corner stone even a few inches, their practiced "routine" shots fall apart.
