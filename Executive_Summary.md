# CSAS 2026: Power Play Analytical Framework
## Executive Summary for Judges

### **The Challenge: Beyond "Napkin Math"**
Most analytical approaches to the Mixed Doubles Power Play (PP) fail because they treat it as an independent event. Our framework recognizes the PP for what it truly is: **a variance injector.** 

For a statistically superior team like GBR (Mowat), the PP is insurance. For an explosive, high-recovery team like Team USA (The "Chaos Agents"), it is a **weaponized opening.**

### **Core Innovations**

#### 1. Counterfactual Policy: "The First Strike"
In baseball, a **Closer** is a scarce resource usually saved for the 9th inning. However, elite managers deploy their closer in the 1st or 2nd inning if the "fire" is high enough to decide the game early. We evaluated the End 1 Power Play as a **"Fireman Closer"** strategy. 
- **Strategic Parallel**: Our framework validates weaponizing this scarce resource early to disrupt opponent rhythm, specifically for high-recovery teams like Team USA.

#### 2. Opening Script Library (Shots 1-3)
We identified that the first three stones' sequence dictates the end outcome. We mapped high-yielding scripts like **"The Knockout"** (Draw->Draw->Raise, 2.69 pts) to help coaches script recovery.

#### 3. International Benchmarking: The USA Edge
Our dashboard proves Team USA's competitive advantage:
- **World-Leading Execution**: 3.24 points avg on first-3-shots (Exceeding GBR and CAN benchmarks).
- **Chaos ROI**: USA produces **28.1% Big Ends** on PP, nearly 3x the GBR technical baseline.

#### 4. The Shot Selection EV Calculator
We developed a **Decision Support Model** (N=600) that provides explicit Expected Value (EV) for key call options (Draw, Wick, Freeze, Raise) after Shot 3.
- **Actionable Guidance**: Coaches receive a "Default Call" based on the highest EV for the current ice state.
- **Risk Quantification**: We quantified a **12.3% shot failure rate** and significant steal risk for the "Draw Under Guard" pitfall, providing a technical basis for the **Tick** alternative.

#### 5. Competitive Edge: The Chaos State Index (CSI)
We defined a USA-specific **CSI** based on high-leverage congestion. While technically superior teams avoid clutter, our model proves USA's Big End probability spikes in high-CSI environments, validating the "Chaos Agent" identity.

#### 6. Field Innovation: The 30-Second Bench Card
To bridge the gap between analytics and ice, we compacted the entire framework into a **1-page decision engine**. This converts complex state-bucket probabilities into actionable binary choice for coaches under the pressure of the shot clock.

### **Methodological Standard**
- **Nonlinear Modeling**: Used XGBoost to capture interactions between score state, end number, and geometry that linear models miss.
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Explicitly separated observed data ranges from strategic inferences, using the model for **leverage discovery** rather than as a causal oracle.

### **Conclusion**
This framework solves the "translation gap" in sports analytics. It takes 26,000+ shots and boils them down to a **Bench Flow** decision engine designed for Olympic gold.
